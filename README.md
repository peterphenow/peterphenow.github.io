### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Peter Phenow and I am currently enrolled in a web development coding bootcamp with the University of Minnesota.

I'm really enjoying learning everything I can in the bootcamp and can't wait to get started with my new career.  
I hope you enjoy looking through my portfolio, I've had a lot of fun creating these projects.
